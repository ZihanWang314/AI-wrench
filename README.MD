**AI-wrench** is a toolkit of simple, powerful tools to boost productivity in AI development. Designed to simplify code management and model interactions, AI-wrench supports developers with solutions that fit seamlessly into existing workflows.

## ðŸ“¦ Tools Included

### ðŸ”¹ [dump-to-GPT](http://www.github.com/zihanwang314/dump-to-GPT)

Easily share your codebase with GPT models using [`dump-to-GPT`](http://www.github.com/zihanwang314/dump-to-GPT). It organizes your code and generates a structured report in one step.

- **Quick Command**: `python dump_gpt.py --dir [YOUR_CODEBASE_DIR]`
- **Organized Output**: Full code summaries, ready to paste into GPT.

### ðŸ”¹ More Tools Coming Soon

Stay tuned for tools focused on model testing, debugging, and project management. We plan to release a lot of lightweight, and even **single line-of-code** tools including data visualization / exploration / annoataion, and much more. 

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Clone the repository and access each tool from its folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZihanWang314/AI-wrench
cd AI-wrench
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

For `dump-to-GPT`, navigate to its folder and run the command above.
